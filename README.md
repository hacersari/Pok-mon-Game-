# Pok-mon-Game-

This project was homework of the Allen school CSE class and it is about using AJAX to fetch data in text and JSON format. Then processing that information using DOM manipulation. 
Each Pokemon is represented as a miniature image in a Pokedex, which is an encyclopedia of different Pokemon species. A Pokedex entry will connect directly to a Pokemon card in this assignment, which is a card of information for a single Pokemon species that has a larger image of the Pokemon, type and weakness information, its set of moves, health point data, and a brief description.
Each Pokemon has 18 different types and one vulnerability type (fire, water, grass, normal, electric, fighting, psychic, fairy, dark, bug, steel, ice, ghost, poison, flying, rock, ground, and dragon) (also from this set of 18 types).
